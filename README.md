# y86FibonacciSequence

This project is a Y86 assembly program that checks whether given numerical sequence is all fibonacci numbers.

## Mathematical Approach

This project follows following formula:

A number `n` is a Fibonacci number if and only if one of the following conditions holds:
1. `5*n^2 + 4` is a perfect square.
2. `5*n^2 - 4` is a perfect square.

## Details:
The project uses binary masks, look up tables and peasant algorithm
